5. How could we use this in the future?
    1. Our hope is that this research will benefit LGBTQ+ students at UCLA in identifying common themes and brainstorming community-based or institutional solutions so that they can advocate for more inclusive housing for UCLA students. We also hope that this model can be replicated at other campuses. Through amplifying the voices of UCLAâ€™s very own undergraduate and graduate students, we hope to provide a platform that ultimately helps the University create and provide more resources and accommodations for marginalized students.
